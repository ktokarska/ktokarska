### Hi there 👋

💻🌐 I am a climate scientist, currently interested in interpretable and physically-informed machine learning applications to climate data analysis.

🌱 I’m currently learning about interpretable neural networks (where the NN is learning from, and is it for the right reasons?)

🏔 My research focuses on climate-carbon interactions and the remaining carbon budgets for the Paris Agreement - you can find more information here: https://www.kasiatokarska.com/my-work.html

🌎🔥I am also a core member of Climate Change AI (https://www.climatechange.ai/), which is an amazing community connecting machine learning experts with climate scientists to work and collaborate together in adressing climate change. 
Feel free to visit that website to sign-up for our monthly newsletter and/or join us for virtual Happy Hours.

😃📷⛷ I'm also on twitter (https://twitter.com/kasia_tokarska) and 500px (landscape photography) https://500px.com/p/kasia_tokarska?view=photos
